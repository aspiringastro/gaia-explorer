## Computing galactic orbits of stars with Gaia

This work is based on the excellent work done [here](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/generated/examples/coordinates/plot_galactocentric-frame.html#sphx-glr-generated-examples-coordinates-plot-galactocentric-frame-py) and used by the original authors, Adrian Price-Whelan, Stephanie T. Douglas to help learn the orbit models with Gaia data. See example [here](https://learn.astropy.org/tutorials/gaia-galactic-orbits.html)
